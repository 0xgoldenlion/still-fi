# Cross-Chain Resolver Example: Atomic Swaps between Ethereum and Stellar

This project demonstrates secure and atomic cross-chain asset transfers between Ethereum and Stellar networks using Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs). It showcases how users can safely exchange assets across different blockchain ecosystems without requiring trusted intermediaries.

## üåü Overview

The Cross-Chain Resolver Example implements atomic swaps that enable users to exchange assets between Ethereum (USDC) and Stellar (XLM) networks. The system ensures that either both parties receive their desired assets, or both parties can safely reclaim their original funds - there is no scenario where one party loses assets while the other gains them.

## üîê Core Concept: Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)

The atomic swap mechanism relies on three key cryptographic primitives:

### Hashlock
- A cryptographic commitment using a secret value
- The same secret unlocks escrows on both chains
- Ensures that revealing the secret on one chain enables withdrawal on the other

### Timelock
- Time-based constraints that prevent funds from being locked forever
- Allows parties to reclaim their funds if the swap doesn't complete
- Different timelock periods for withdrawal vs. cancellation phases

### Atomicity
- **Success**: Both parties get their desired assets
- **Failure**: Both parties reclaim their original assets
- **No Partial Completion**: Impossible for only one side to complete

## üåê Supported Networks

- **Ethereum**: Source chain for USDC transfers using EVM smart contracts
- **Stellar**: Destination chain for XLM transfers using Soroban smart contracts

## üîÑ Swap Scenarios

### 1. Successful Ethereum to Stellar Swap

**Flow:**
1. User locks USDC in Ethereum escrow with hashlock
2. Resolver deploys and funds XLM escrow on Stellar with same hashlock
3. User reveals secret to withdraw XLM from Stellar escrow
4. Resolver uses revealed secret to withdraw USDC from Ethereum escrow

**Result:** User receives XLM, Resolver receives USDC

### 2. Cancellation Scenario

**Flow:**
1. User locks USDC in Ethereum escrow
2. Resolver deploys and funds XLM escrow on Stellar
3. Secret is NOT revealed within timelock period
4. Both parties cancel their respective escrows after timeout

**Result:** User reclaims USDC, Resolver reclaims XLM

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Ethereum Components
- **EscrowFactory**: Deploys escrow contracts with deterministic addresses
- **Resolver Contract**: Orchestrates cross-chain operations and manages escrow lifecycle
- **Node.js Integration**: Handles Ethereum transactions and smart contract interactions

### Stellar Components
- **Pre-deployed LOP Contract**: `CDLWW5OUQZWE76WLYGKN6TCOG2UKOZ4HTOU5UN6RMNTXOCMDVWHE5UO4`
- **Escrow Factory**: `CACURHRDVGNUCFSMDWTIF6TABC76LNTAQYSIVDJK34P43OYOGPSGYDSO`
- **Shell Script Integration**: Manages Stellar operations via CLI commands

### Cross-Chain Coordination
- **Shared Cryptographic Proof**: Same secret/hashlock used on both chains
- **Time-Synchronized Execution**: Coordinated timelock periods ensure safety
- **Deterministic Addressing**: Escrow addresses can be computed before deployment

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Security
